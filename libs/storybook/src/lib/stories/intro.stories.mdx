# Welcome to Veera UI library!

These friendly docs contain detailed information on how to install and use implementations of [Veera Design System](https://veera.eesti.ee) in code. 

The implementations include a shared CSS library (preprocessed with Sass) and HTML examples based on it, as well as a UI kit in Angular.

Please choose an item you need in the sidebar to the left (press `S` if you don't see it).

Veera UI library is a neverending work in progress that welcomes any feedback and becomes better thanks to you, its users. Contact us at Slack or directly by email [veera@eesti.ee](mailto:veera@eesti.ee).
